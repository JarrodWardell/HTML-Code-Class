    <h1>Who is Jerd?</h1>
    <p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br>Beats me!</p>
    <h2>To begin with:</h2>
    <p>You may be asking youself, just <i>who is</i> this person who has created a website so terrible, so horrible, that it is assaulting my eyeballs with simple black and white text? <br>Well, a few things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First off, how dare you! My website is perfectly beautiful! Who could be offended by 1990's era website design?</li>
      <li>Secondly, My name is actually Jarrod Wardell!</li>
      <li>Thirdly, again, this is a beautiful website. It's all about personal preference though, I suppose.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Now that that's out of the way:</h2>
    <p>Hi! As we've established, I'm Jarrod! Online, I'll often go by the nickname Kenny.<br> It was a nickname given to me by my first girlfriend, just an easy way of saying my middle name, and it kind of stuck!</p>
    <p>I'm currently a Grade 11 Technology Student at Six Nations Polytechnic STEAM Academy.<br>My interests are vast, so here's a list! It's in no particular order.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Computer programming!<p>I <i>absolutely <b>love</b></i> programming! I find it so amazing, and so awesome to see something I've created come to life in front of my eyes! Sure, it can be frustrating, but at the end, when you're begging, <i>praying to some godabove</i> that your program will work, and it does, there's no better feeling!<br>Then you immediately break the program, of course, in an attempt to further it, and make it better.</p></li>
      <li>Music!<p>I really enjoy music. Playing, singing, collecting, or just rocking out to a good band is a great thing to do. Heck, I'll rock out to just about anything! I try to write my own songs, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but most of all I just try to have fun!<br>In fact, I recently obtained "A Night With John Denver", the '74 print LP Album of a John Denver concert from my good friend Bailey. I've been playing it non-stop! Heck, the vinyl will probably be worn right through by the needle by the end of this year! Lot's of rocking out to do, it always brightens up a day, no matter how bright or dull it may already be. :)<br>Oh, and my current favorite song is "Grandma's Feather Bed" by, of course, John Denver.</p></li>
      <li>Video Gaming!<p>This one should be evident. Seriously, are there any teenagers interested in coding that don't play at least one video game? I'm currently in love with Minecraft, I just love the freedom it affords players! Creating beautiful builds, block by block, while fighting against the odds of limited resources and persistantly annoying enemies! Nothing could be more relaxing, other than John Denver, of course.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Some less interesting stuff:</h2>
    <p>This is more my previous achievements, academically or personally.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Reciever of the CGW Mathematics Award in 2018</li>
      <li>Reciever of numerous awards at the SNP STEAM Academy</li>
      <li>Well-known modeller in the ROBLOX Community</li>
    </ol>
