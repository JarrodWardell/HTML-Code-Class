    <h1>Who is Jerd?</h1>
    <h2>To begin with:</h2>
    <p>You may be asking youself, just <i>who is</i> this person who has created a website so terrible, so horrible, that it is assaulting my eyeballs with simple black and white text? <br/>Well, a few things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First off, how dare you! My website is perfectly beautiful! Who could be offended by 1990's era website design?</li>
      <li>Secondly, My name is Jarrod Wardell!</li>
      <li>Thirdly, again, this is a beautiful website. It's all about personal preference though, I suppose.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Now that that's out of the way:</h2>
    <p>Hi! As we've established, I'm Jarrod! Online, I'll often go by the nickname Kenny.<br/> It was a nickname given to me by my first girlfriend, just an easy way of saying my middle name, and it kind of stuck, to be honest.</p>
    <p>I'm currently a Grade 11 Technology Student at Six Nations Polytechnic STEAM Academy.<br/>My interests are vast, so here's a list! It's in no particular order.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Computer programming!<p>I <i>absolutely <b>love</b></i> programming! I find it so amazing, and so awesome to see something I've created come to life in front of my eyes! Sure, it can be frustrating, but at the end, when you're begging, <i>praying to some godabove</i> that your program will work, and it does, there's no better feeling!<br/>Then you immediately break the program, of course, in an attempt to further it, and make it better.</p></li>
      <li>Music!<p>I really enjoy music. Playing, singing, collecting, or just rocking out to a good band is a great thing to do. Heck, I'll rock out to just about anything! I try to write my own songs, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but most of all I just try to have fun!<br/>In fact, I recently obtained "A Night With John Denver", the '74 print LP Album of a John Denver concert from my good friend Bailey. I've been playing it non-stop! Heck, the vinyl will probably be worn right through by the needle by the end of this year! Lot's of rocking out to do, it always brightens up a day, no matter how bright or dull it may already be. :)</p></li>
